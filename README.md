# Simple Google GeoChart Example

## What is a GeoChart?

A geochart is a map of a country, a continent, or a region with areas identified in one of three ways:

• The region mode colors whole regions, such as countries, provinces, or states.

• The markers mode uses circles to designate regions that are scaled according to a value that you specify.

• The text mode labels the regions with identifiers (e.g., "Russia" or "Asia").

A geochart is rendered within the browser using SVG or VML. Note that the geochart is not scrollable or draggable, and it's a line drawing rather than a terrain map; if you want any of that, consider a map visualization instead.
